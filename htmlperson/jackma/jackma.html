            Jack Ma Yun[a] (Chinese: 马云; pinyin: mǎ yún; born 10 September 1964) is a Chinese business magnate, investor and philanthropist. He is the co-founder and former executive chairman of Alibaba Group, a multinational technology conglomerate. In addition, he co-founded Yunfeng Capital, a private equity firm. Ma is a strong proponent of an open and market-driven economy.

            In 2017, Ma was ranked second in the annual "World's 50 Greatest Leaders" list by Fortune.[3] He has widely been considered as an informal global ambassador for Chinese business, and is an influential figure for the community of startup businesses.[4] In September 2018, he announced that he would retire from Alibaba and pursue educational work, philanthropy, and environmental causes;[5][6][7][8] the following year, Daniel Zhang succeeded him as executive chairman.[9]

            As of October 2021, with a net worth of $42.3 billion, Ma is the fourth-wealthiest person in China (after Zhong Shanshan, Ma Huateng and Zhang Yiming), as well as one of the wealthiest people in the world, ranked 32nd by Bloomberg Billionaires Index.[2] In 2019, Forbes named Ma in its list of "Asia's 2019 Heroes of Philanthropy" for his work supporting underprivileged communities in China, Africa, Australia, and the Middle East.[5][10]
