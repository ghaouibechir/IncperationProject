                Elon Reeve Musk FRS born June 28, 1971 is an entrepreneur and business magnate. He is the founder, CEO,
                and Chief Engineer at SpaceX; early stage investor, CEO, and Product Architect of Tesla, Inc.; founder
                of The Boring Company; and co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI. A centibillionaire, Musk is the richest
                person in the world as of September 2021.[2]

                Musk was born to a Canadian mother and South African father and raised in Pretoria, South Africa. He
                briefly attended the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada aged 17 to attend Queen's
                University. He transferred to the University of Pennsylvania two years later, where he received
                bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford
                University but decided instead to pursue a business career, co-founding the web software company Zip2
                with brother Kimbal. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. The same year, Musk
                co-founded online bank X.com, which merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. The company was bought
                by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion.

                In 2002, Musk founded SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company, of which
                he is CEO and CTO. In 2004, he joined electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.)
                as chairman and product architect, becoming its CEO in 2008. In 2006, he helped create SolarCity, a
                solar energy services company that was later acquired by Tesla and became Tesla Energy. In 2015, he
                co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research company that promotes friendly artificial intelligence. In 2016,
                he co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company focused on developing brain–computer interfaces, and
                founded The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. Musk has proposed the Hyperloop, a high-speed
                vactrain transportation system.

                Musk has been the subject of criticism due to unorthodox or unscientific stances and highly publicized
                controversies. In 2018, he was sued for defamation by a British caver who advised in the Tham Luang cave
                rescue; a California jury ruled in favor of Musk. In the same year, he was sued by the US Securities and
                Exchange Commission (SEC) for falsely tweeting that he had secured funding for a private takeover of
                Tesla. He settled with the SEC, temporarily stepping down from his chairmanship and accepting
                limitations on his Twitter usage. Musk has spread misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic and has
                received criticism from experts for his other views on such matters as artificial intelligence,
                cryptocurrency, and public transport.
